# Countries (Journey Mentor)

Countries project which is related to Journey Mentor company of Cyprus, is here to help humen in order to improve our knowledge about countries, geography, etc.

**Take a look at it: [Journey Mentor](https://journey-mentor-demo.vercel.app/)**

The project has been implemented by Ali Bahaari and his tiny knowledge about Vue 3. The implementation of the project helped him to improve some skills and get more familiar with Vue 3 and its ecosystem which pretends simliar (somehow!) to React. I hope this project finds the director of technical leads well in order to be selected as the best project has ever been implemented in the world ;) _(Just a kidding!)_
